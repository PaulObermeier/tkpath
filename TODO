TODO for tkpath
---------------

 o There are a lot of duplicated code for each item which is due to the
   canvas item registration mechanism. Perhaps a simplification with generic
   handlers. For instance, tkCanvPolyline.c and tkCanvPolygon.c don't
   differ by many significant lines; very annoying and embarrasing!

 o Optimize segmentation computations used for hittesting in the 'Point'
   functions.

 o Use registration mechanism for styles that item uses so items get redisplayed
   when a style is configured.

 o Perhaps an OpenGL renderer.
