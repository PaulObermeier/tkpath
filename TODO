TODO for tkpath
---------------

 o Optimize segmentation computations used for hittesting in the 'Point'
   functions.

 o Perhaps an OpenGL renderer.

 o Perhaps lightweight items with no own style options but only a reference
   to a styleName to save a lot of memory. See TreeCtrl.

 o I have paid no attention to if strokes are transformed or not. Sort out!

 o Perhaps it would be useful to allow multiple objects on a single item
   by supplying many coordinates for pline, prect, circle, and ellipse ?

 o In the new items Configure proc we duplicate a lot of code.
   If we had a larger generic Tk_PathItemEx struct we could perhaps
   also have generic code for this.

 o I would like to move the TkPathInit/TkPathFree to the canvas
   Display function instead of having it in the items Display function.
   This is currently not possible due to the X11 emulation code
   used by the old items. This would save a lot of cpu, on aqua 
   in particular.

 o Try to get rid of the Tk_Uid.
